# pf906-LCD-display
This is a discussion of the LCD display of the pf906 LIEO treadmill

Im using the Arduino code kindly written by MartyMacGyver (https://github.com/MartyMacGyver/LCD_HT1622_16SegLcd - modified and updated) to control the Holtek HT1622 and HT1625 LCD controller chips, although it was originally driven by a PIC, and Id like to reprogram that PIC to do my bidding, but Ive not figured out yet what that is.  Maybe this will be simply a learning exercise, that it has been to date, and it was fun to do.

My Youtube video for the small LCD is located at ... https://youtu.be/MFptCfe7_l4
And for the large LCD is at ... (TBA)

Have Fun!
