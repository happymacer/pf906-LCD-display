# pf906-LCD-display
This is a discussion of the smaller LCD display of the pf906 LIEO treadmill

Im using the Arduino code kindly written by MartyMacGyver (https://github.com/MartyMacGyver/LCD_HT1622_16SegLcd) to control the Holtek HT1622 LCD controller chip, although it was originally driven by a PIC, and Id like to reprogram that PIC to do my bidding, but Ive not figured out yet what that is.  Maybe this will be simply a learning exercise, that it has been to date, and it was fun to do.

Next I want to do a video on working out the connections and control of the larger display but I'll put that separate to this one when I get around to that.

My Youtube video is located at ...https://youtu.be/MFptCfe7_l4

Have Fun!
